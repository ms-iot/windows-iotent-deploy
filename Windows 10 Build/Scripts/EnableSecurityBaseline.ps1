#The baseline can be installed in either setup phase (OOBE or Audit). If installed during Audit the default user account created during OOBE must meet the password minimum requirements set
#by the policy baseline. If installed during OOBE any user accounts with passwords that do not meet the requirements will require having their password udpated.
